## Overview

This repo is associated with this [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.21.524489v2.abstract). The code contains the RNN decoder (NeuralDecoder) and language model decoder (LanguageModelDecoder) used in the paper and can be used to reproduce the core decoding results offline. NeuralDecoder should be installed as a python package and LanguageModelDecoder needs to be compiled. The notebooks in AnalysisExamples show how to prepare the data for decoder training, train the RNN decoder, and evaluate it using the language model. An example of how to make a PSTH is also included.
